# Premises

_Check Your Premises_

## Overview

Premises is a concept visualization and study tool based on Aristotelian/Objectivist principles of concept formation and definition. It provides an interactive environment for exploring conceptual relationships, focusing on the hierarchical structure of knowledge through genus-differentia definitions.

## Live Application

_Example: Exploring the concept of "Art" and its relationships. Try it yourself at [https://lebbe.github.io/premises#concept=art](https://lebbe.github.io/premises#concept=art)_

## StudyView Features

The StudyView is the primary interface for focused conceptual study and exploration:

### Core Functionality

- **Concept Search & Selection**: Search across multiple conceptual universes with intelligent weighting that prioritizes Ayn Rand's definitions
- **Interactive Graph Visualization**: Dynamic network display of conceptual relationships with customizable layouts
- **Focused Study Mode**: Build graphs around specific concepts with configurable traversal depth (1-5 levels)
- **Relationship Filtering**: Toggle between genus edges (generalizations) and differentia edges (specializations)

### Navigation & State Management

- **URL-Based State**: All graph states are encoded in URLs, enabling bookmarking and browser navigation
- **Browser Integration**: Full support for back/forward buttons and right-click "Open in new tab"
- **Persistent Configuration**: Layout options, edge filters, and universe selections are preserved across sessions

### Conceptual Hierarchy

- **Genus-Differentia Structure**: Visualizes the logical structure of definitions following Aristotelian principles
- **Hierarchical Layout Algorithm**: Specialized layout that tends to place genus concepts above and differentia concepts below their references
- **Dynamic Edge Attachment**: Intelligent edge positioning based on conceptual relationships and node positions

### Interactive Features

- **Concept Info Panel**: Detailed view of selected concepts showing definitions, sources, and relationships
- **Focus Navigation**: Click through conceptual networks via genus/differentia links
- **Multi-Universe Support**: Explore concepts across different philosophical and scientific domains
- **Real-time Search**: Dropdown suggestions with focus-triggered display

### Study Workflow

1. **Search**: Find concepts using the intelligent search with universe-weighted results
2. **Focus**: Select a concept to build a focused graph around it
3. **Explore**: Navigate through genus and differentia relationships
4. **Configure**: Adjust traversal depth, layout direction, and relationship visibility
5. **Navigate**: Use browser history to move between different conceptual focuses

The tool embodies the Objectivist approach to concepts as "units of thought" that integrate similarities while omitting measurements, providing a visual framework for understanding the hierarchical structure of knowledge.

## Important Disclaimers

### Work in Progress

**This is a work in progress.** The concept definitions, genus classifications, and differentia specifications contained in this application can and will contain errors. All errors and inaccuracies are the sole responsibility of the project owner, Lars-Erik Bruce.

### Content Sources & Generation

- **Ayn Rand Definitions**: Definitions attributed to Ayn Rand are taken directly from her published literature
- **LLM-Assisted Content**: Except for Ayn Rand's original definitions, an LLM (Large Language Model) has been used to generate genus classifications, differentia specifications, and definitions for undefined concepts, all under the guidance of the project owner
- **Human Review**: All generated content has been reviewed and approved by the project owner, but may still contain philosophical or logical errors

### Feedback & Corrections

We strongly encourage all users to help improve the accuracy of conceptual definitions:

- **GitHub Issues**: Please create issues in this repository to report errors or suggest improvements
- **Contact**: Reach out to Lars-Erik Bruce directly for corrections to concept definitions, genus classifications, or differentia specifications
- **Contributions**: Your expertise in philosophy, science, or specific conceptual domains is valuable for improving this tool

The goal is to create an accurate and philosophically sound representation of conceptual relationships. Your feedback is essential to achieving this objective.
